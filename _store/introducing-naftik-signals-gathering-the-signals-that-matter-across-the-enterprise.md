title: Introducing Naftiko Signals -- Gathering the Signals That Matter Across the Enterprise
description: >-
  This is the Naftiko Capabilities podcast for January 6th, 2026, where we sit down with Mike Amundsen and Christian Posta to ask, "What is a Capability?" Mike brings a rich understanding of the web, hypermedia, and semantics, while Christian dives into the technical details from the artificial intelligence perspective, MCP, and the gateway view of capabilities. This discussion is helping inform what we are building at Naftiko when it comes to capability-centered integrations and automation, kicking off a new podcast series focused on aligning engineering and business with capabilities thinking that helps us all get down to business when it comes to enterprise integrations.
